Here is the (translated) abstract :

This thesis examines whether the empirical relationship between the inflation rate and the level of central bank independence from 1975 to 1995 is influenced by the political orientation of the government in power. The study uses a legal indicator of independence that breaks it down into several dimensions. The application of various estimation and inference methods for panel data is discussed.

The results suggest that central bank independence significantly affects inflation when governments are centrist. However, the findings do not support the conclusion that the level of independence impacts inflation under left-wing or right-wing governments. Finally, these results do not appear to hold for wealthy and democratic countries, which contradicts the literature asserting that the appropriate indicator for measuring independence in industrialized nations is the legal one.
